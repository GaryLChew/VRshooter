# VR Shooter
A simple first-person shooter using the Gear VR and its controller.

## Behind our Project

### Context
This project was far more ambitious than any other I had had before. At the end of my senior year, my APCSA teacher assigned 
us a open-ended month-long project. Many other groups opted to create their projects in Java (we had studied Java and only Java), 
but after playing on a HTC Vive myself, I desperately wanted to create a virtual reality game.

I had never created a serious Unity or C# project before, so there was a lot I needed to learn. My team and I quickly went through Unity's
tutorials, learning its basics. Luckily, C# was similar enough to Java that we managed to pick it up quickly.

### Choosing to develop on the Gear VR
*To be added later.
